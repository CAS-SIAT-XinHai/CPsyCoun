## Method

### CPsyCoun Framework

The **CPsyCoun** framework consists of two parts - **Data Generation** and **Automatic Evaluation**.

![Framework](Fig/Framework.png)


### Dialogue Reconstruction

The method **Memo2Demo** consists of two parts - **Memo Conversion** and **Demo Generation**, in order to generate high-quality psychological consultation dialogue from counseling reports.

#### Counseling Report

Acoording to the Chinaâ€™s National Class
II Psychological Counselor Examination and other
psychological counseling literature, the counseling report is normalized into **six parts**: 
*Title, Type, Method, Case Brief, Consultation Process and Experience Thoughts*.

* An example of counseling report 

![Counseling_Report](Fig/Counseling_Report.png)

#### CPsyCounD

The high-quality multi-turn dialogue dataset, which has a total of **3,134 multi-turn consultation dialogues**. 
* For more details, please refer to the [CPsyCounD](CPsyCounD/README.md).


### Evaluation Framework

#### Evaluation Metrics

* **Comprehensiveness**
  * The clientâ€™s situation and the degree to which
psychological problems are reflected in the dialogues.
* **Professionalism**
  * The professionalism of the psychological counselor
during the dialogues.
* **Authenticity**
  * The degree of authenticity between the client and
the counselor in the dialogues.
* **Safety**
  * The degree of privacy protection of clients.

#### Score Criterion

* The score criterion of each evaluation metric

#### Turn-Based Dialogue Evaluation

**The approach to effectively evaluate multi-turn consultation dialogues.**

Denote a $m$-turn dialogue as a set of paired elements $\{(q_i,r_i)|i=1, 2, ..., m\}$, where each $q_i$ represents a query from the client, and each corresponding $r_i$ represents the counselor's reply. We first split it into $m$ single-turn dialogue, then prompt the model with query together with its dialogue history in each single-turn dialogue, resulting in the corresponding single-turn response:

![math_1](Fig/math_1.png)

where $h_i=\{(q_j, r_j)|j=1, 2, ..., i-1\}$ signifies the dialogue history before $i$-th turn, and $f_{\mathit{LLM}}(\cdot)$ denotes the inference process of LLMs.

Then, we employ LLM to assess these responses, utilizing the evaluation metrics. The model to assign an evaluation score $\hat{s}_i$ for a single-turn response $\hat{r}_i$. Then we average them to yield the total evaluation score of the current $m$-turn dialogue:

* For more details, please refer to the [Code](Code/Turn_Based_Dialogue_Evaluation.ipynb).

#### CPsyCounE

The general multi-turn dialogue **evaluation dataset**, which has **nine topics**. 
* For more details, please refer to the [CPsyCounE](CPsyCounE/README.md).


### Experiments

#### Intrinsic Evaluation

##### Role-play VS Memo2Demo

* Statistics of generated dialogues

* The results of intrinsic evaluation

#### Extrinsic Evaluation

##### CPsyCounX

We further fine-tune **InternLM2-7B-Chat** on **CPsyCounD**. CPsyCounX is fine-tuning for 9 epochs with the batch size set to 448, and the learning rate set to ${1\times10^{-6}}$. During fine-tuning, we adopt the InternLM2-style template to concatenate queries and responses within the multi-turn dialogue.
* For more details, please refer to the [Code](Code/sft_CPsyCounX.sh).

##### Results

* The average results of extrinsic evaluation
